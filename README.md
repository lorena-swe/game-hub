In this project, I worked with the RAWG.io API to develop a web app displaying a comprehensive list of video games, which can then be filtered by keywords, genres, and platforms, as well as sorted by multiple variables. The website also provides loading skeletons for a seamless and interactive user experience! I had plenty of fun developing this project, as video games are one of my fondest passions and inspired me to get into the programming world in the first place!

### Features

- **Comprehensive Game List**: Displays a wide range of video games using the RAWG.io API.
- **Filtering**: Filter games by keywords, genres, and platforms.
- **Sorting**: Sort games by various criteria.
- **Loading Skeletons**: Provides a smooth user experience while data is being fetched.

### Built With

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Chakra UI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/)
- TypeScript
- HTML & CSS
- [RAWG.io API](https://rawg.io/apidocs)
