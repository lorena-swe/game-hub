In this project, I worked with the RAWG.io API to develop a web app displaying a comprehensive list of video games, which can then be filtered by keywords, genres, platforms, as well as sorted by multiple variables.
<br />
The website also provides loading skeletons for a seamless and interactive user experience!
<br />
I had plenty of fun developing this project, as video games are one of my fondest passions and inspired me to get into the programming world in the first place!
